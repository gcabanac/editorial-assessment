# Analysis of journals' timelines for editorial assessment

The `1-code/editorialAssessment.py` script retrieves metadata from Crossref about a journal's output.


### Use Case
We ran it on September 6, 2021 to retrieve the metadata of articles published since 2018 in the [*Arabian Journal of Geosciences*](https://www.springer.com/journal/12517) (ISSN 1866-7538, a Springer journal). See the `2-results` folder produced with [Jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org).
